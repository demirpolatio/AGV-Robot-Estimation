# AGV-Robot-Estimation
Data Science Approach to Agv Traffic Control


The focus of this project is determining number of AGV robots of a white good factory that need to use for production lines. For determining workload location, mission and other variables of AGV is observed. By using machine algorithm in Python, we implement classification and regression to our codes for gathering information from data. As a result, we examine the reliability of codes in term of regression and classification performance metrics.  

The data used is confidential.
